Notes and stuffs as I explore  [VEDA](https://github.com/fand/veda).

Although I just use this as a workbench and place to jot down ideas, please do feel free to PR new ideas, add attributions, ask questions, etc.

As I only intended on this being for my own personal amusement, I probably missed a bunch of sources n such. That being said, I know for sure that I pull many SDF functions from http://mercury.sexy/hg_sdf/
